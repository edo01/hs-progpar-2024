**ANALYSIS**: 
- We observed the following trends:
    1.  As expected, the bandwidth of the L1 cache is higher than the L2 cache, which is higher than the RAM bandwidth.
    2.  The bandwidth of the both the two caches and the RAM is higher for the Denver-2 compared to the Cortex A-57. This 
        is evident from the single core execution and even from the multi-core execution, where Denver-2 uses only 2 cores
        and still has only slightly lower bandwidth than the Cortex A-57 which uses 4 cores.
    3.  Doubling and quadrupling the number of cores does not lead exactly to doubling or quadrupling the bandwidth.
        The most efficient increase in bandwidth is observed in the L1 cache, decreasing as we move to the L2 cache and RAM.
        This is due to the fact that memory consistency and coherence protocols should be implemented to ensure that the data
        is consistent across all the cores, which leads to some overheads. 
    4.  The trend of the bandwidth in the full system analysis is less defined, as the bandwidth is influenced by the 
        communication between cores in different chips. This is evident from the fact that the bandwidth of the RAM in the
        full system is comparable to the bandwidth of the RAM in the Denver-2, which uses only 2 cores.
